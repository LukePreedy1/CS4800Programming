Takes in a list of integers.  First, two integers.  The first, N, is the number of cities.
The second, M, is the number of routes between cities.  Then, takes M pairs of integers.
In the pairs, the first number is the number of the city the route leaves from.  The second
is the number of the city the route goes to.  The program will then print out a list of integers
representing the number of cities that are reachable from each city.  If the city cannot reach
any other cities, will print -1.

Worth noting that in this program, the given numbers and cities starts at 1, not 0.  Not my choice,
that's just how the problem was designed.  Everybody knows that arrays should start at 0.
