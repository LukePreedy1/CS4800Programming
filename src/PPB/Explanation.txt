The problem is: given 3 numbers.  The first, N, is the number of cities, the second, M, is the number of 
directional routes between cities, the third, S, is the number of the city that is the capital city.
The program is then given M sets of 3 numbers, the first is the number of the city that the route
is leaving from, the second is the number of the city that they route is going to, the third is the
length of the route.  The program, when run, will take all that input, then print out the shortest distance from
each city to the capital, with each distance separated by space.  If the city cannot reach the capital,
will print out -1.


The one that is actually working is W3.java, the others were previous, unsuccessful attempts.
